<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>I have a plethora of hobbies that are mostly physical by nature. Despite enjoying, a relaxing morning of watching ESPN highlights while making coffee and breakfast, I have found that anything triathlon related has taken up my efforts and free time. I am an avid runner and cyclist as both of these hobbies require me to get up and out of the door to submit myself to the elements of nature. Ive found myself to being an frequent listener of all podcast related to foreign relations. My favorite being <mark>BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) News </mark>. When I am not reading on current events, I like to take breaks to memorize my favorite dad jokes! For example:</p>
